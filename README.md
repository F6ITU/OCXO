# OCXO
Aiôn, a 10 MHz OCXO reference

Aiôn is the god of the cyclic time in ancien Greece

This very basic and simple OCXO 10 MHz clock could be used 
as a reference for an RF generator, a frequency meter, or
any kind of equipment needing a precise timebase.

It has been originally designed to fit the "external clock input"
of any modern Software Defined Radio, Angelia being one of them

This board has been integrated in the "Alex" pcb series
